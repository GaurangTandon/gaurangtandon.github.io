- CS theorists argue that move-to-front content organization is within twice of the optimal algorithm (sleator/tarjan 1985)
  - move-to-front encoding in bzip2 compression algo
- yet i organize content in my life against their wishes
- i organize electricity/water/loan payment receipts
- i organize warranty and purchase receipts of electronics/hardware/etc.
- i organize files in my computer into folders and drives
- answers
  - organization helps with access control (can share a part of the whole quickly enough)
  - organization makes historical queries and analyis of subtopics of your content much faster (how many games do I have? how many notes i have written?)
- in this book somewhere in the sorting section it was mentioned that sorting is usually a waste of time because the time to do insertion sort is much higher than the amount of people most people spend doing complex historical queries (find item X queries can be done by move-to-front either way)
